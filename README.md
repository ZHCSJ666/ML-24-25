## Features

- **Data Collection**: Extract code changes and commit messages from Git repositories.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare training data.
- **Model Training**: Train a language model to generate commit messages.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance and optimize.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
